<div> </div>&#xD;

<div>You—or someone who uses your computer—previously set up this computer to use DuckDuckGo instead of Google. You will not be able to access any Google services while this remains in effect.</div>&#xD;
&#xD;
<div> </div>&#xD;
&#xD;
<div>If you want to undo this change, remove the following line from your /etc/hosts file:</div>&#xD;
&#xD;
<div><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; ">184.72.115.86</span> www.google.com<br>&#xD;
 </div>&#xD;
&#xD;
<div>If you don’t understand how to do this, simply bring these instructions to your local nerd. (Don’t try to explain it - print out these exact instructions on a piece of paper and hand it to them.)</div>&#xD;
