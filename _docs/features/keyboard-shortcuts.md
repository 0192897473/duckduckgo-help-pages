You can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate the results (as opposed to the mouse).

**Open results:**

-   Enter or l or o — go to the highlighted result, or use it right away to go to the first result
-   Ctrl/Cmd+Enter — open a result in the background
-   d — domain search (if a result is highlighted)
-   ' or v — open the highlighted result in a new window/tab. Since this uses JavaScript, you need to turn off pop-up blockers first.

**Move around:**

-   ← and → — navigate Instant Answer tabs. When an Instant Answer is open, navigate within the Instant Answer.
-   ↓ or j — next search result
-   ↑ or k — previous search result
-   / or h — go to search box
-   s — go to misspelling link (if any)
-   t — go to top
-   m — go to main results

If you don't like the keyboard shortcuts, you can turn them off [in the settings](https://duckduckgo.com/settings).
