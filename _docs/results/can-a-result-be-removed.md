DuckDuckGo search results come from a combination of sources as they are a mixture of different search modules (for examples, images, news, etc.), Instant Answers (for example, definitions, calculations, etc.), and traditional links. See [this help page]({{ site.baseurl }}/results/sources/) for more information on where DuckDuckGo search results come from.

As explained on that page, while most non-traditional search results come from DuckDuckGo and other sources, most traditional search results currently come from Bing. So, to request removal of traditional links that appear in search results, you will need to submit your request directly to Bing first.

The links below provide next steps to complete your request with Bing:

After completing your request with Bing, once verified, changes will automatically be reflected in DuckDuckGo search results.

If you have already submitted a request to Bing and the removed links are still appearing in DuckDuckGo search results, please email [privacy@duckduckgo.com](mailto:privacy@duckduckgo.com), as it may indicate the result is from another source.
