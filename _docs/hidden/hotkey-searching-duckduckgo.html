On Linux:<br><br><a href="http://ostatic.com/blog/more-automation-with-autokey">This post</a> by Jon Buys, via the Ostatic Blog, details how to create a popup box that uses your default browser to search DuckDuckGo. You can set a custom key combination to generate a pop-up search box and quickly search for your entered text on DuckDuckGo.<br><br><br>&#xD;
On Windows:<br><br>&#xD;
Users can highlight text and press their assigned key combination to search DuckDuckGo for the highlighted text. This requires downloading the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/download/">AutoHotkey program</a> and, once installed, performing the following:&#xD;
<ol><li>Right click the blank space on your Desktop</li>&#xD;
	<li>Select New--&gt;AutoHotkey Script</li>&#xD;
	<li>Rename the resulting file to whatever you'd like, making sure the file ends in the extension .ahk</li>&#xD;
	<li>Right click your new file and select, Edit Script.</li>&#xD;
	<li>Paste the following below any text that's currently in the window:</li>&#xD;
</ol><br>&#xD;
#InstallKeybdHook<br>&#xD;
#Persistent<br>&#xD;
#HotkeyInterval,100<br>&#xD;
SetKeyDelay, -1<br>&#xD;
#space::<br>&#xD;
{<br>&#xD;
Send, ^c<br>&#xD;
Sleep 50<br>&#xD;
Run, https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%clipboard%<br>&#xD;
Return<br>&#xD;
}<br><br>&#xD;
The configuration above uses the key combination of Windows Key and Spacebar to perform the action. This is denoted on the line: #space::<br>&#xD;
This can be changed to whichever combination you'd like, just replace #space with whatever you prefer (keeping the double colon, :: ). The full list of possibilities and additional instructions can be found on the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm">AutoHotkey website</a>.<br>&#xD;
Once configured, just highlight whatever text you'd like and press your key combination to trigger the search!&#xD;
