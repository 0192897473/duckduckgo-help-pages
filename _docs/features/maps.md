If a map is particularly relevant for your search, one will appear automatically. Examples:

- [*coffee near me*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=coffee+near+me)
- [*map philadelphia*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=map+philadelphia)

You can click on these maps to expand them, giving you not just an interactive map where you can pan and zoom, but also a directions feature. DuckDuckGo map searches and route planning are powered by [Apple's MapKit JS framework](https://developer.apple.com/maps/web/).
