<html><body><p>&#xD;
Our partnership with Yahoo helps us give you the best search experience possible, and helps Yahoo generate revenue.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
Of course, in accordance with our strict <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>, we do not share personal information with any partners, including Yahoo. To make this crystal clear, Yahoo has also published a <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/search-for-desktop/SLN27299.html">privacy statement</a> to the same effect. We're proud to work closely with a partner who is willing to work with us to protect your privacy.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
In addition to the existing Yahoo technology we've been using, our latest partnership with Yahoo enables DuckDuckGo to get access to features you've been requesting for years:&#xD;
</p><ul><li>Date filters let you filter results from the last day, week and month.</li>&#xD;
<li>Site links help you quickly get to subsections of sites.</li>&#xD;
&#xD;
</ul><p>&#xD;
All of this functionality is not fully rolled out yet, but will be soon!&#xD;
</p>&#xD;

<p>&#xD;
We've worked closely with Yahoo to implement these new features in accordance with contractual terms and our privacy policy. To be as transparent as possible, we've written up details on the <a href="https://duck.co/help/results/yahoo-technical-implementation">technical implementation</a>.&#xD;
