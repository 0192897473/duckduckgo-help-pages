[DuckDuckGo Email Protection](https://duckduckgo.com/email) is a free email forwarding service that removes multiple types of hidden email trackers and lets you create multiple unique private email addresses on the fly. Email Protection works with your current email account â€“ no need to change providers or juggle multiple inboxes.

If you have a [Privacy Pro]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/) subscription, you can enhance Email Protection with [Personal Information Removal]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/personal-information-removal), which finds and removes personal data, like your email address, from broker sites that sell it.
