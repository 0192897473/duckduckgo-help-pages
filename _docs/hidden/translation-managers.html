<html><body><p>Our community is constantly translating DuckDuckGo into their languages. For every language, there's a large set of submitted translations, some good and some bad. To make sure that only the good ones are used on DuckDuckGo, we enlist the help of our community!</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>Translation Managers oversee the submitted translations in their languages. They're like moderators but for translated words, instead of forum comments.</p>  &#xD;
