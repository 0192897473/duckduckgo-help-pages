## Instant Answers

DuckDuckGo uses over 100 sources to provide answers to your searches, without the need to click on a result. Just look for the Instant Answer above the results:

Of course, things like [calculations](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=2+%25+2&ia=calculator) and [factual information](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=people+in+space&ia=answer) are covered, but you may be surprised by number of Instant Answers DuckDuckGo actually has — from [checking the status of a flight](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=AA+102) to [generating a strong password](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=password+strong+12&ia=answer) — we've got an Instant Answer for it.

## !Bang Syntax

You can search other sites directly from DuckDuckGo, just by using our available [!bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs).

For example, if you wanted to search on Amazon.com for, "shoes" you could simply type: _!amazon shoes_

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/bangs.png" />

...which would automatically take you to Amazon.com and search for shoes...

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/amazon-shoes.png" />

Many of the !bangs even have short versions. Use 'a' for Amazon or 'w' for Wikipedia. For example: !a shoes or !w shoes

There are [thousands of sites covered](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs) and you can even [submit your own!](https://duckduckgo.com/newbang)
