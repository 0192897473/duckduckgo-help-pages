Yes, for Android, MacOS, and iOS, you can easily reactivate (and deactivate) private Duck Addresses within the Passwords dashboard in the DuckDuckGo browser. First, select the browser menu, then open _Passwords_, select the private Duck Address you want to reactivate (or deactivate), and follow the on-screen prompts.

If youâ€™re using Windows or the DuckDuckGo browser extension (and alternatively for Android, MacOS, and iOS), find an email sent to the address you want to reactivate and click/tap the _Deactivate_ button in the DuckDuckGo banner at the top of the email. This will allow you to reactivate the address, which can also be deactivated following the same steps.
