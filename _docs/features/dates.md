When searching on DuckDuckGo, you have the ability to limit search results to a certain timeframe.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
For example, searching for "<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=spacex">spacex</a>" could include some older or general results, whereas you might be more interested in recent articles and news reports.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
If you instead want to see results from the past day, week, or month, you can select that from the date filter dropdown to the right of the search box on desktop.&#xD;

On mobile, it's available in the menu by tapping the "3-line" icon at the top right. Note that these are both visible after doing a search.&#xD;

We're monitoring comments that we receive from the "Send feedback" button on desktop, so feel free to let us know how it's working for you. We listen!&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
P.S. We are working on implementing the past year as well!&#xD;
