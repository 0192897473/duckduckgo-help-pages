We get results from a variety of [sources]({{ site.baseurl }}/results/sources) (including our own). Because of this unique way of generating results, we cannot easily determine the number of results for a particular search ahead of time. That's why we do not display such a number in our search results.

In addition, there are a bunch of reasons you may not be getting as many results as you think you should for a particular query.

-   We try to be [very exact]({{ site.baseurl }}/results/autocorrect) based on what you type in, whereas other search engines often change your query around a bit. So that is the first thing to look at. That is, if you slightly change your query do you get more results?
-   Related to exactness, it could be your use of [punctuation]({{ site.baseurl }}/results/punctuation).
-   We could have had a brief outage on our side. You could try a hard refresh (usually ctrl/cmd-R) to clear your cache and try again.
-   If none of these apply, and you are still getting sparse results for a search you think really should be giving you more results, [please send in the specific search](https://duckduckgo.com/feedback). It might be something we can easily fix!
