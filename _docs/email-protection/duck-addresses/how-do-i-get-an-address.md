When you sign up for DuckDuckGo Email Protection, you get to pick a personal Duck Address (example: name@duck.com). Any emails sent there will be stripped of email trackers on our block list and then forwarded to whatever personal forwarding email address you provide, arriving at your regular inbox. Within forwarded emails, we’ll tell you how many trackers we’ve removed and what companies appear to be behind them.
