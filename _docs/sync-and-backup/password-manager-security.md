The DuckDuckGo password manager has a range of robust security protections in place to keep your passwords safe and accessible only by you. These include: 

- **End-to-end encryption**
- **Biometric or password access**
- **Secure password generation**
- **Phishing protection**
- **Keeping you in control**

## End-to-end encryption 

End-to-end encryption means that your data is encrypted before it is uploaded to DuckDuckGo’s servers, and it’s only decrypted after it’s downloaded onto your device. In other words, it’s encrypted from one end (the first device) to the other end (a second device) and is only readable in plain text from your devices that contain the encryption key. 

DuckDuckGo does not have access to the encryption key and cannot read the data stored on our servers. Even if someone were to breach our servers and gain access to your data, it would remain encrypted, and they wouldn’t be able to read it without your encryption key. 

You can find out more about end-to-end encryption in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sync-and-backup/sync-and-backup-privacy/">this help page</a>. 

## Biometric or password access 

Your passwords are locked on your device and can only be accessed or used by unlocking them with your Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode. 

## Secure password generation 

Using the same password for different sites makes that password less secure, and remembering unique passwords for all your sites can be a pain. The DuckDuckGo password manager gives you one-touch access to a strong random password whenever you sign up to a new site, which you can easily access whenever you sign back in.  

## Phishing protection 

To help keep you safe online, and your passwords out of the hands of scammers, our password autofill option only appears on sites that meet our online security criteria. 

## Keeping you in control 

Our password manager won’t enter your password on a website without your interaction, so if something about the site seems dodgy you can choose not to proceed.
