No. DuckDuckGo has no relationship with Google, and, unlike some other search engines, we do not rely on Google’s results for any of our search results. You may notice that we offer a Google Chrome extension and a Google Android app, but these are also not in partnership with Google and actually aim to protect you from Google’s online trackers.
