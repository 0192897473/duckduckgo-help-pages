## Does DuckDuckGo store personal information of Privacy Pro subscribers?

We only save the minimum personal information we need for the service to function. To protect your identity, we assign a random ID to your Privacy Pro subscription that we use to activate your subscription on your devices. You can optionally add an email address for ease of activation. We will only use personal information you provide (for example, your email address if you choose to provide it) to make the service function and for no other purpose.

When you pay for your Privacy Pro subscription, your payment is processed and managed via Google, Apple, or Stripe, depending on what platform you subscribed. Their respective privacy policies and terms of service apply to payment processing.

## What happens to my data after I cancel my subscription?

If you choose to cancel Privacy Pro, we will delete any personal information we have (for example, your email address) within 30 days, unless we are legally required to keep it longer.
