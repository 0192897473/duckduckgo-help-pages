For Android, MacOS, and iOS, you can easily deactivate (and reactivate) private Duck Addresses within the Passwords dashboard in the DuckDuckGo browser. First, select the browser menu, then open _Passwords_, select the private Duck Address you want to deactivate (or reactivate), and follow the on-screen prompts.

If youâ€™re using Windows or the DuckDuckGo browser extension (and alternatively for Android, MacOS, and iOS), find an email sent to the address you want to deactivate and click/tap the _Deactivate_ button in the DuckDuckGo banner at the top of the email. This will deactivate the address, which can also be reactivated following the same steps.
