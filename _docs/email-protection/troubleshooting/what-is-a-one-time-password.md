Instead of using a traditional password, DuckDuckGo Email Protection uses One-Time Passcodes (OTPs) for account sign-in. Whenever you need to sign in to your Email Protection account, we’ll send you an email with a One-Time Passcode that you’ll need to enter in the same browser you’re trying to sign in from.

If you’re having issues signing in, please make sure that you’re pasting the code within the time limit stated in the email, and that you’re requesting and entering the One-Time Passcode in the same browser.
