<h2>Contributing Matters</h2>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>We know that Wikipedia would always beat out Encarta. We believe that DuckDuckGo is an incredible distribution platform for an open-source community to change how the web works. We're up against multi-billion-dollar giants - and the only way to avoid becoming them is to be inseparable from the community.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>Our goal is to have <strong>85% of queries covered by Instant Answers</strong> (currently this is at 19%).</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<h2>Jump Right In</h2>&#xD;
