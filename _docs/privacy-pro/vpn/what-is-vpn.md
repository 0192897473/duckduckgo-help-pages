DuckDuckGo VPN (short for Virtual Private Network) is a service that gives you an extra layer of protection online by encrypting your Internet connection across your entire device and hiding your location and IP address from the sites you visit. It’s built for speed and simplicity.

## How do I get DuckDuckGo VPN?

DuckDuckGo VPN is included in the DuckDuckGo Privacy Pro subscription. To subscribe to Privacy Pro and use our VPN, first download the DuckDuckGo Browser on mobile or desktop and subscribe to Privacy Pro in the browser’s settings. Once you’ve subscribed, you’ll be able to install and manage the VPN from the settings menu in the browser.

## How does DuckDuckGo VPN work?

Enabling the DuckDuckGo VPN establishes a secure, encrypted connection (VPN tunnel) between your device and one of our VPN servers. For all your device's network traffic that passes through this tunnel, the VPN prevents others, such as your Internet Service Provider, from seeing this activity. It also prevents your Internet destinations, like web sites, from seeing your device’s IP address.

## Is all network traffic protected or only web browsing?

The VPN protects Internet connections across your full device, not just your web browsing activity. If the VPN experiences an interruption, all internet traffic will automatically be blocked until the VPN either reconnects or you turn off the VPN.

## Why should you use DuckDuckGo VPN over others?

Unlike many other VPNs, our VPN is private with a strict no-logging policy. It is also easy to use; there’s no need to install a separate app and, using the DuckDuckGo browser, you can connect in just one click. Our VPN offers full device coverage on up to 5 devices at once and is fast and reliable, with servers across the US, Canada and Europe.

DuckDuckGo VPN is also the only VPN that works with DuckDuckGo [App Tracking Protection]({{ site.baseurl }}/p-app-tracking-protection/) on Android devices.

## In which countries can I use DuckDuckGo VPN?

Privacy Pro is currently only available to U.S. residents. If you’re a Privacy Pro subscriber traveling outside of the United States, you can use the VPN anywhere it is legal to do so.
