<br>&#xD;
Many DuckDuckGo users opt for ad-blocking software and browser extensions, like Adblock Plus, that prevent our advertisements from displaying. We understand and respect your decision to limit exposure to advertising, which is why DuckDuckGo allows users to disable ads through our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">Settings menu</a> ((under the General tab &gt; Advertisements).<br><br>&#xD;
Because of our belief in a better search experience with less clutter, our ads have always been extremely minimal, unintrusive, and clearly marked as different than the other results (they always have an Ad badge).<br><br>&#xD;
Further, our ads should be relevant to your search, as they're meant to be helpful. If you see a bad ad, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/feedback">let us know!</a><br><br><strong>We ask that you help support DuckDuckGo by disabling ad blockers on our domains.
