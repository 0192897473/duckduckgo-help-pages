<html><body><p>To combat spamming from botnets and other malicious services, our system automatically blocks IP addresses that approach a queries-per-second limit. If you've been mistakenly blocked, via the use of our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/api">API</a> or other means, you should see service returned within a few hours. If, after 24 hours, you're still unable to access DuckDuckGo, please send an email to <a href="malito:ops@duckduckgo.com">ops@duckduckgo.com</a> and we can investigate further.</p></body></html>
