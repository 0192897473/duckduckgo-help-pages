Autosuggest (also known as autocomplete) is available for DuckDuckGo across platforms, including [our website](https://duckduckgo.com/), [browser extensions](/desktop/adding-duckduckgo-to-your-browser), [Android app](/mobile/android) and [iOS app](/mobile/ios).

To be clear, [we don't track you, and autosuggest does not impact that at all](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy) â€” we simply do not associate autocomplete queries with unique identifiers (e.g., IP addresses) so that no search histories can be created.
