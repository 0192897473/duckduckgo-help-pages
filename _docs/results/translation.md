We've partnered with Microsoft to provide a [translation feature][translation-feature] for some searches.

![Screenshot of the translation module on a results page]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/translations.png)

When we pass queries to search result and Instant Answer <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/results/sources/">providers</a> they are proxied through our servers so they stay completely anonymous. This is true when you enter a search to trigger the translation feature as well.

When you enter text into the translation module on our search results page, we never save or pass personal information to Microsoft's translation service. The source text you enter, the source language, and selected translation language are all we need to deliver an accurate translation and are [not stored][no-trace] by Microsoft.
