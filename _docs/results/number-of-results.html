<html><body><p>We get results from a variety of <a href="https://duck.co/help/results/sources">sources</a> (including our own). Because of this unique way of generating results, we cannot easily determine the number of results for a particular search ahead of time. That's why we do not display such a number in our search results.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>In addition, there are a bunch of reasons you may not be getting as many results as you think you should for a particular query.</p>&#xD;
<ul><li>We try to be <a href="https://duck.co/help/results/autocorrect">very exact</a> based on what you type in, whereas other search engines often change your query around a bit. So that is the first thing to look at. That is, if you slightly change your query do you get more results?</li>&#xD;
	<li>Related to exactness, it could be your use of <a href="https://duck.co/help/results/punctuation">punctuation</a>.</li>&#xD;
	<li>We could have had a brief outage on our side. You could try a hard refresh (usually ctrl/cmd-R) to clear your cache and try again.</li>&#xD;
	<li>If none of these apply, and you are still getting sparse results for a search you think really should be giving you more results, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/feedback">please send in the specific search</a>. It might be something we can easily fix!</li>&#xD;
