DuckDuckGo can server local results (for searches like ["restaurants nearby"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=restaurants+nearby)) while still keeping you anonymous. [Read more about how it works]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/anonymous-localized-results).

For some search results you can opt-in to anonymously and securely use your browser location, in accordance with our [privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy). This will help further improve the accuracy and relevancy of search results.

### If you experience issues trying to use your location:

-   Ensure you have a strong WiFi or Cellular connection
-   Try re-starting your web browser
-   Check to make sure you have Location Services enabled on your device

#### Chrome, Firefox, and Brave

1. Click the **permissions icon** in the address bar
1. Ensure location is **allowed**
1. **Reload** DuckDuckGo search, and try again

If the browser location in Firefox remains unavailable, then go to â‰¡ Menu &gt; Preferences &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Permissions &gt; Location &gt; Settings, and ensure 'Block new requests asking to access your location' is unchecked. Reload DuckDuckGo, and try again.

#### Safari

1. Open the Safari menu and select **Settings for DuckDuckGo...**
1. Ensure Location is set to **Allow**
1. **Reload** DuckDuckGo Search, and try again

If the browser location in Safari remains unavailable, then open the Safari menu and go to Websites &gt; Location, and ensure duckduckgo.com is set to Allow. Reload DuckDuckGo Search, and try again.

### You can disable your location again at any time

To do so, open [Settings](https://duckduckgo.com/settings), scroll down to 'Location', and use the 'Clear' button. You can also manually clear your browser cookies for duckduckgo.com.
