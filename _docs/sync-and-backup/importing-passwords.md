#### On Mobile:

The DuckDuckGo browser for iOS and Android doesnâ€™t support password import via .CSV files. Instead, you can use Sync & Backup:

1. Import your passwords onto DuckDuckGo for Mac or Windows on your computer as explained below.
1. Set up **[Sync & Backup]({{ site.baseurl }}/sync-and-backup/)** to access them on your mobile device.

#### On Desktop:

Download or Export Passwords as a .CSV File:

1. Open the browser or password manager where you currently have your passwords stored.
1. Find the option to export passwords and download them as a .CSV file.
1. Refer to your browser or password manager's documentation for specific instructions.

#### Import to DuckDuckGo:

1. Open DuckDuckGo on your Mac or Windows computer.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Passwords & Autofill**.
1. Select **Import Passwords...** and follow the on-screen instructions.

#### Access your Passwords from other devices:

1. Set up **[Sync & Backup]({{ site.baseurl }}/sync-and-backup/)** to access your passwords on other devices.
1. You will need to sync other devices with your Mac or Windows app.
