We will sometimes serve localized results (for searches like ["restaurants nearby"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=restaurants+nearby)) while still keeping you completely anonymous. [Read more about how it works]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/anonymous-localized-results).

For some search results you can opt-in to anonymously and securely use your browser location, in accordance with our [privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy). This will help further improve the accuracy and relevancy of search results.

### If You Experience Problems Trying to Enable Your Location:

-   Ensure you have a strong WiFi or Cellular connection.
-   Try re-starting your web browser.
-   Using the instructions below, ensure you have Location Services enabled.
