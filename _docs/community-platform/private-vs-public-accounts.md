<html><body><h3>Comparing account types</h3>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>When you register a new account on Duck.co, your account is automatically set to Private. Your username will appear as "hidden" to other members and visitors of Duck.co and your user page will not be accessible to others. However, administrators can still see your real username, to assist with account related issues.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>If you set your profile to Public, then visitors and members will be able to see your username and user page. </p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<h3>How to change your account type</h3>&#xD;
&#xD;
<ol><li><a href="https://duck.co/my/account">Visit the My Account page.</a></li>&#xD;
  <li>Under <em>Your Account</em>, click <em>Make it private</em> or <em>Make it public</em>.</li>&#xD;
