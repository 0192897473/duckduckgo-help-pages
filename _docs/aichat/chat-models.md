[DuckDuckGo AI Chat](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=DuckDuckGo&ia=chat){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} currently supports OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo and Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku. You can change your default chat model at any time by clicking on the current chat model name – in the left sidebar.

## Does DuckDuckGo moderate chat responses in any way?

No, we do not filter or modify the responses received from the chat model in any way. As such, responses may contain inaccurate or offensive information. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/content-moderation){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} each have their own moderation policies, and you may see those applied when using their models, respectively.
