    DuckDuckGo is available in over seventy different languages and regional
    dialects.
</p>

<p>
    You can choose what language you want DuckDuckGo to be displayed in
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">on the settings page</a>. It is the
    second option from the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
    However, please note that not all of the translations are complete. We welcome
    your help to finish translating DuckDuckGo
    <a href="https://duck.co/translate">here</a>.
