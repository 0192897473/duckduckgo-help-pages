<html><body><p>We're actively looking for a Front-end Developer to join our Community team.</p> &#xD;
&#xD;
<p>Every day, our developer community at DuckDuckHack submits Instant Answers to our search engine. As staff, we work with contributors to polish their Instant Answer code (and idea) until the final product is a useful and beautiful Instant Answer on DuckDuckGo.com that works across a broad range of devices and platforms.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>Our developer community is diverse in culture and programming experience, so some contributions require a bit more polishing than others. In many cases, developers get tripped up by some nuances in the front-end implementation of their Instant Answers.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>This team member would be responsible for working with contributors to refine the front-end portion of their Instant Answer submissions until they're acceptable for use live on DuckDuckGo. Further, this person will polish our own platform and processes such that these issues are less frequent (or non-existent) over time.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>To see what we mean, check out this Pull Request where our staff + community helped kbhat95 adjust the design on their <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/pull/1860">Playing Cards Instant Answer.</a></p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>The issue of needing to customize or adjust the front-end for an Instant Answer is common. Using the Playing Cards Instant Answer as an example, the optimal front-end candidate will make strategic decisions that reduce the occurrence of adjustments to the front-end code by a contributor. For example, by creating templates or styleguides for the scenarios where our contributors frequently need help.</p>&#xD;
