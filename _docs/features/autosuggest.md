<p>To be clear, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">we don't collect or share personal information and auto-suggest does not impact that at all</a>. We simply do not associate queries with personal information (e.g. IP addresses) and in fact don't store any of it at all so our auto-suggest doesn't impact your privacy!</p>&#xD;
