We have two non-JavaScript versions of our search results, which come up automatically for some browsers that don't work with the regular JavaScript version.

-   [HTML](https://duckduckgo.com/html)
-   [Lite](https://duckduckgo.com/lite)

However, keep in mind that these non-JavaScript sites lack some of the features present on the primary site because of its heavy use of JavaScript.
