<html><body><p>If you are missing the first result on our search results, e.g. official sites, this is probably due to an adblock setting. There was an errant adblock filter that was filtering all of our first results, i.e. the #r1-0 id. If you update your adblock subscription, it should resolve itself.</p></body></html>
