<p>DuckDuckGo supports search syntax you can use to fine-tune your queries.</p>

<h3>Search Operators</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use <code>site:</code> to limit your search results to pages from a specific website. For example, <code>dogs site:example.com</code> will return pages about dogs from the website example.com.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use <code>–site:</code> to eliminate pages from a specific website from showing up in search results. For example, <code>cats –site:example.com</code> will remove any example.com pages from your list of search results about cats.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Search Directly on Other Sites</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use <code>\</code> to go to directly to the first search result. For
        example,
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%5Cfuturama"><code>\futurama</code></a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use <code>!</code> to search other sites' search engines directly. Remember,
        though, because your search is actually taking place on that other site, you
        are subject to that site’s policies, including its data collection
        practices. For example,
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!a blink182"><code>!a blink182</code></a>
        searches Amazon.com for blink182. There are
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">thousands of sites covered</a>!
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Safe Search</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Add <code>!safeon</code> or <code>!safeoff</code> to the end of your search
        to turn on and off
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/features/safe-search">safe search</a> for that
        search.
    </li>
</ul>
