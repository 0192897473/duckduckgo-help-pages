It's natural to assume that there'd be some kind of downside, since we respect your privacy and we don't track you. But it's a [myth]({{ site.baseurl }}/company/how-duckduckgo-makes-money/) that creepy tracking is a necessary tradeoff. DuckDuckGo does everything you'd expect of a browser and search engine — while still protecting your privacy.

Our free [DuckDuckGo browser](http://duckduckgo.com/browser) includes our private alternative to Google search, along with [over a dozen other privacy protections]({{ site.baseurl}}/privacy/web-tracking-protections/) for your browsing, email, and more. The browser’s comprehensive set of protections is used by tens of millions of people to help take back control of their online privacy.

[DuckDuckGo Search](http://duckduckgo.com/) includes news, maps, sports scores, weather, stocks, local results and much more — in addition to the standard links, images, and videos, of course. And unlike Google, it’s actually private and anonymous. Nothing bad about that.
