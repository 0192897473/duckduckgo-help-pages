<p>Of course, things like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=2x+%2B+6+%3D+12+solve&amp;ia=calculator">calculations</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=calories+in+2+eggs">factual information</a> are covered but what's more interesting are the surprises you'll find as Instant Answers:</p><p></p>

<p>From <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=AA+102">checking the status of a flight</a> to finding <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=rhyme+list">words that rhyme together</a>, we've got an Instant Answer for it.</p>

<h3>!Bang Syntax</h3>

<p>You can search other sites directly from DuckDuckGo, just by using our available <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html">!bangs</a>.</p>

    <p>For example, if you wanted to search on Amazon.com for, "shoes" you could simply type: <em>!amazon shoes</em></p>

<img src="../images/028e3901ce00cfae77634090c4858b22.png"><p>...which would automatically take you to Amazon.com and search for shoes...</p>

<img src="../images/ee7aeb76c38a71bc938e5ef404023ae0.png"><p>Many of the !bangs even have short versions. Use 'a' for Amazon or 'w' for Wikipedia.</p>

    <p>For example: !a shoes   or   !w shoes</p>
    
    <p>There are <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html">thousands of sites covered</a> and you can even <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/newbang">submit your own!</a></p>
    
    <p>If you're using our <a href="https://duck.co/help/desktop/adding-duckduckgo-to-your-browser">browser extension</a> or, if you have DuckDuckGo as your browser's default search-engine, the !bang commands will even work from the address bar or search bar. <strong>WARNING: Use of !bangs will forever change the way you search, leaving you with more free time and less frustration. </strong></p>
    
<h3>In-site Search</h3>
