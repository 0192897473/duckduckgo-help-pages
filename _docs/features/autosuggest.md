Autosuggest (also known as autocomplete) is available for DuckDuckGo across
platforms, including <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">our website</a>,
<a href="/desktop/adding-duckduckgo-to-your-browser">browser extensions</a>, <a href="/mobile/android">Android app</a> and
<a href="/mobile/ios">iOS app</a>.

To be clear, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">we don't track you, and autosuggest does not impact that at all</a> â€” we simply do not associate autocomplete queries with unique identifiers (e.g., IP addresses) so that no search histories can be created.
