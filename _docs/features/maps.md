If a map is particularly relevant for your search, one will appear automatically. Examples:

- [*coffee near me*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=coffee+near+me)
- [*map philadelphia*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=map+philadelphia)

Location results will not only give you the option for an interactive map, where you can pan and zoom, but also for directions. DuckDuckGo map searches and route planning are powered by [Apple's MapKit JS framework](https://developer.apple.com/maps/web/).

Note that our strict privacy policy of not collecting or sharing any personal information extends to location searches. We do not send any personally identifiable information such as IP address to Apple or other third parties. For local searches, where your approximate location information is sent by your browser to us, we discard it immediately after use. You are still anonymous when you perform map and address-related searches on DuckDuckGo. You can read more about our [anonymous localized results here](/privacy/anonymous-localized-results/).
