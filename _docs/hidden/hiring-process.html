<br>Being effective in our remote work environment is hard to figure out from interviews alone. As such, we like to work with you for a period of time to see if there is a good fit on both sides. The progression usually looks like: &#xD;
&#xD;
<br><br>1) Contact&#xD;
<br>2) Paid, part-time evaluation project&#xD;
<br>3) Conversations with the team&#xD;
<br>4) Paid, part-time or full-time contracting on internal projects&#xD;
<br>5) Join the full-time staff </p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>We are happy to work through the process on a flexible timeline around your current schedule, and have navigated through it successfully in a variety of scenarios, including people with full-time jobs in Tokyo! &#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>1) First contact&#xD;
<br>It's pretty easy to stand out in your <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/hiring">initial application</a> by conveying your knowledge and interest in DuckDuckGo. We especially react well to product criticism, which quickly shows creativity and that you've really thought about what we're trying to do here. If your interests and skill-set match with an open role we will reach out to schedule time for a conversation between you and members of our team.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>2) Paid, part-time evaluation project&#xD;
<br>This project varies per position and is designed to establish if you are a good match for the particular position. We've been doing our best to keep these projects to a minimum, expect 1 or 2 projects that usually take 10 hours to complete. The way to shine here is to ask questions as they come up, and communicate effectively.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>3) Conversations with the team&#xD;
<br>If the evaluation project goes well (if it doesn't, we encourage people to try again in six months), we introduce you to a few members of the team over video chat, or in person if you're close by to someone and want to meet up. These conversations will focus on past work experiences, future goals, and are an opportunity for you to ask questions!</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>4) Paid, part-time or full-time contracting on internal projects&#xD;
<br>At this stage we only contract with people if we think we want to hire them full time. The majority of people we bring on internally get hired, though sometimes it doesn't work out. Again, at this and every stage, we are flexible working with you based on current work/other schedules.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>5) Join the full-time staff&#xD;
<br> Once we both feel there is a good fit you will work with the team manager to make a transition from internal contractor to full time team member. As a full time team member you will be able to enjoy our internal benefits and continue to work on meaningful projects in your area of expertise and interest.</p>&#xD;
