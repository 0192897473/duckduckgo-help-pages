<html><body><p>The "Stories" functionality will be removed from this app within the next few weeks. We are focusing our efforts on an app that helps you take back your privacy while you search and browse the web.<br><br>
As much as we like the "Stories" feature, it doesn't fit within our privacy mission and this seemed like a natural time to remove it. We hope that you'll like the upcoming features even better, but we also recognize that this might inconvenience you. If so, we're sorry about that!<br><br>
We're very excited to share this new app with you soon. If you'd like to check out what's coming, or have any general feedback for us, contact us at ios@duckduckgo.com. We really listen!</p></body></html>
