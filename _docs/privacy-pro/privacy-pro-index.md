Privacy Pro is a three-in-one privacy subscription service from DuckDuckGo, accessible directly from our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/get-duckduckgo/does-duckduckgo-make-a-browser">browser</a>:

-   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/personal-information-removal">Personal Information Removal</a> finds and removes your personal details, like your name and physical address, from sites that store and sell it, helping to combat identity theft and spam.
-   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/identity-theft-restoration">Identity Theft Restoration</a> gets you back on track if your identity is stolen, helping you fix your credit report and recover financial losses.

You can subscribe to Privacy Pro via the Settings menu in the DuckDuckGo browser, available for {% include privacy-pro-browser-list.md %}. Privacy Pro is only available in the U.S.
