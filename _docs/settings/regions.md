<html><body><p>To boost results for your region, click the region button - <img src="/edition-jekyll-template/images/c87b8ae4409fa8ddfd500a047b8f9c14.png" style="vertical-align: bottom"> - to the far right of the search results.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>You can also change your region setting on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">the settings page</a>.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>On a per-search basis, you can change your region setting by adding <em>r:code</em> to your search. (For example, <em>r:fr</em> for France.) The full list of region codes are on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/params">the parameters page</a>.</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>Changing your region setting will boost the ranking of search results from that region, as opposed to exclusively displaying results from that region. You can restrict your results to a country's domains by adding <em>site:ccTLD</em> to your search. A ccTLD is the ending of that country's domains, such as .uk for the United Kingdom. So for example, adding <em>site:uk</em> to your search would only show results from .uk websites.</p>&#xD;

<p>Unfortunately, we don't have complete control over the options available for the region setting. We rely on some external sources to help us with them - but we're constantly monitoring our sources to allow for more regions!</p></body></html>
