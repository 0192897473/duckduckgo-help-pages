Yahoo is one of our primary technology partners that we use to <a href="https://duck.co/help/results/sources">get results</a>. In accordance with our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>, we never share any personal information with any of our partners, including Yahoo. To make that crystal clear, Yahoo itself published a <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/search-for-desktop/SLN27299.html">privacy statement</a> to that effect. We're proud to work closely with a partner who is willing to work with us to protect your privacy.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
For general information on the DuckDuckGo-Yahoo partnership, click <a href="https://duck.co/help/company/yahoo-partnership">here</a>. Below, we've written up details below on the technical implementation of our Yahoo partnership. When you do a search on DuckDuckGo, depending on the particular search, we will make a call to Yahoo for links, ads and other content.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<h2>DNS Delegation</h2>&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
To get access to the most relevant Yahoo technology, due to contractual obligations that call has to be associated with a Yahoo domain, in this case, <a href="https://duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net">duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net</a>. To make sure this call does not violate our privacy policy, Yahoo delegates this domain to us via <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/domain_Name_System?ia=about">DNS</a>. In other words, duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net is operated by DuckDuckGo and runs solely on our servers. Yahoo does not have access to these servers in any respect.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
This DNS delegation can be verified by doing a dig on duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net:&#xD;

&#xD;
<h2>SSL Configuration</h2>&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
Also, as we use strong encryption by default, we needed a separate SSL certificate for this subdomain in particular. Yahoo has authorized us to get our own SSL certificate, which is operated by DuckDuckGo and runs solely on our servers, which again Yahoo does not have access to in any respect. The certificate validity can be verified by clicking on the lock icon in the browser:&#xD;

&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
We use <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/">SSL Labs</a> to help us make sure our SSL configuration is set up in the the most private and secure search experience possible. Here are the reports for our DuckDuckGo-owned Yahoo subdomain and our main site:&#xD;

&#xD;
<h2>Script Blockers</h2>&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
JavaScript blocking tools like NoScript are browser add-ons that block JavaScript unless a user explicitly whitelists a script or domain. These add-ons don't know that duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net is actually a pointer to servers owned and operated by DuckDuckGo at results.duckduckgo.com. As such, if you use one of these add-ons, then you will get a notification that a script from yahoo.net is being used. That is actually not the case for the reasons described above.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
Below are a list of steps to safely allow duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net when using a JavaScript blocking tool. Below is what the alert looks like in NoScript.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
You can validate it actually is duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net by clicking options in the bottom right corner:&#xD;
</p>&#xD;

<img src="/images/fa60d8dde9c976449b624501e8331116.iu"></img></p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
Then going to options at the top:&#xD;
</p>&#xD;

<p>&#xD;
<img src="/images/14dc91e817cefad77223df6f0b5c476f.iu"></img></p>&#xD;
</center>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
Then to the appearance tab, and checking the box that says "Full Domains:"&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
<img src="/images/b1c74ae665f4acc8bd0feb99d1a299d2.iu"></img></p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
From there on, you'll be able to see that it actually is duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net, instead of just yahoo.net.&#xD;

<h2>Request Flow</h2>&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
Hereâ€™s the complete request flow for clarity:&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
1) You do a search on duckduckgo.com.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
2) Your browser sends the request to duckduckgo.com, which gets routed to DuckDuckGo's servers.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
3) DuckDuckGo returns the basic page and tells your browser to make more calls to get additional content to build the page. Often, one of those calls is to duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net, a special set of DuckDuckGo's servers that interface with Yahoo.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
4) DuckDuckGo servers (at duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net) make a request to Yahoo for relevant content, protecting your personal information in the process.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
5) Yahoo returns results to the DuckDuckGo servers operating under duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
6) DuckDuckGo returns the relevant content back to the browser.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
&#xD;
<p>&#xD;
7) Your browser uses the content returned from all such requests to render the full results page.&#xD;
</p>&#xD;
