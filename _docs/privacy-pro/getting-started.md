## How do I subscribe to DuckDuckGo Privacy Pro?

You can subscribe to Privacy Pro directly from the DuckDuckGo browser (available on {% include privacy-pro-browser-list.md %}). Open the Settings menu and select “Privacy Pro”.

## Why can’t I see the Privacy Pro subscription in my browser?

If you can’t find Privacy Pro in the Settings menu of the DuckDuckGo browser, it could be because:

-   You don’t have the latest version of the DuckDuckGo browser. Try updating your browser to the most recent version.
    -   To update your browser on macOS, from the app menu bar, go to **DuckDuckGo** > **Check for Updates...**, then click **Install Update**.
    -   If you don’t have automatic updates set up for iOS, go to **Settings**, tap your profile icon, scroll down to DuckDuckGo, and tap **Update**.
    -   On Android, open the Google Play Store. At the top-right, tap your profile icon. Tap **Manage Apps & Device**. If an update is available for DuckDuckGo, tap **Update**.
-   You downloaded our browser from the iOS, macOS, or Android app store and your app store account location setting is not set to the United States, as Privacy Pro is currently only available to U.S. residents.
-   Similarly, it may not show up if you aren’t signed in with your Apple or Google ID on your device. Subscribing via the DuckDuckGo browser for macOS, iOS, or Android requires you to be signed in on your device, in order to process payments through the app store.

## Can I use my subscription on multiple devices?

You can access your subscription on any device that has the DuckDuckGo browser installed, here’s how:

Android:

-   On the device you wish to add your subscription, open the DuckDuckGo app, then tap the three dot icon and then **Settings**.
-   In the Privacy Pro section of Settings, tap **Learn More**, then tap **I Have a Subscription**.

iOS:

-   On the device you wish to add your subscription, open the DuckDuckGo app, then tap the gear icon to access **Settings**
-   In the **Privacy Pro** section of settings, tap **Privacy Pro**, then tap **I Have a Subscription**.

macOS:

-   On the device you wish to add your subscription, open the DuckDuckGo browser, then click the three dot icon next to the address bar.
-   Click **Privacy Pro**, then in the left sidebar click **Privacy Pro**.
-   Click **I Have a Subscription**

Please note:

-   VPN supports connections for up to five devices at once.
-   Personal Information Removal needs to be set up on a desktop computer and, because it stores data only on that device, it can only be accessed through the device on which it was set up.

## What is a One-Time Passphrase (OTP) and how do I use it?

Instead of using a traditional password, DuckDuckGo Privacy Pro uses One-Time Passphrases (OTPs) as an option for activating your subscription. If you have added an email address to your subscription, you can use it to activate Privacy Pro on a new device, or restore your purchase. We’ll send you an email with a One-Time Passphrase that you’ll need to enter in the same browser you’re trying to activate from.

If you’re having issues activating your device, please make sure that you’re pasting the code within the time limit stated in the email, and that you’re requesting and entering the One-Time Passphrase in the same browser.

## Can I share my subscription with friends or family?

We currently don’t offer a Privacy Pro family plan or support sharing a subscription with friends or family.

## Can I subscribe to just one of the three services offered in Privacy Pro?

Currently, Privacy Pro is a bundled subscription and there is no way to subscribe to its features individually.

## I have a question not covered here, how can I get help?

Please contact support at <a href="mailto:privacypro@duckduckgo.com">privacypro@duckduckgo.com</a>. If you have ideas on how to improve Privacy Pro, please share it using the Share Feedback button in the DuckDuckGo browser.
