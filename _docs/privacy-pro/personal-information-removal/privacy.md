For Personal Information Removal to accurately locate your records on data broker sites, it requires you to enter some personal information. However, this personal information stays on your device and not DuckDuckGo servers.

## How does Personal Information Removal keep personal information provided for scanning secure?

Unlike other services, Personal Information Removal happens from your device and not on remote servers. For example, your name, age, address, and phone number are all stored locally on your device. If we find additional related information on data broker sites, like alternative names, phone numbers, or addresses, or the names of your relatives, this information is also only stored locally on your device, not on our servers.

We also submit removal requests to data broker sites on your behalf directly from your device. This is unlike most other services where removal requests are initiated on remote servers. The only personal information we may receive in this process are confirmation emails from data broker sites, which we automatically handle for you and then delete within 72 hours.

## What happens to my personal information if I cancel my Privacy Pro subscription?

If you cancel your Privacy Pro subscription, weâ€™ll stop scanning and sending opt-out requests to data brokers. That means any of your personal info that was previously removed may start showing up on data broker sites again, and we will no longer be assisting with removing it.
